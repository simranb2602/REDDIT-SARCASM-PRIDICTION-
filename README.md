Project Overview:

This project is focused on predicting sarcasm in Reddit comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Detecting sarcasm is an important task in sentiment analysis, especially when analyzing online conversations, as sarcasm can mislead sentiment detection algorithms.

Whatâ€™s Inside:

1.Dataset: A curated dataset of Reddit comments labeled as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

2.Model: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was developed and optimized using GridSearch cross-validation. The model also leverages GloVe embeddings and TF-IDF vectorization for better text representation.

3.Preprocessing: The data underwent text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to ensure optimal performance.

4.Deployment: The model is deployed using Flask, providing a real-time interface for users to input comments and receive predictions through a user-friendly web UI.

Why We Created This Project: The goal of this project is to contribute to the field of sentiment analysis by improving the detection of sarcasm, which poses a challenge for traditional text analysis models. Accurately detecting sarcasm can enhance the performance of social media analytics, customer feedback analysis, and online community moderation systems.

How to Use:

The Reddit Sarcasm Prediction project can be applied across various domains. Below are some potential use cases:

1.Social Media Analytics: Use this model to enhance sentiment analysis in social media platforms by identifying sarcastic comments, ensuring more accurate assessments of user sentiment.

2.Customer Feedback Analysis: Businesses can integrate this sarcasm detection model to analyze customer reviews or feedback, improving the understanding of genuine customer sentiment and addressing sarcastic criticism more effectively.

3.Content Moderation: Online communities or forums can deploy this model to detect sarcastic or potentially harmful comments, assisting moderators in content filtering and improving the tone of discussions.

4.NLP Research: Researchers in natural language processing can use this project to experiment with sarcasm detection models, test variations in text preprocessing, or explore new model architectures for sarcasm classification.

5.Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Integrating this model into conversational agents can enhance the interaction experience by enabling bots to recognize sarcasm, improving their ability to respond appropriately.
